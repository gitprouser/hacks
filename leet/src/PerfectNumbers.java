/**
A perfect number is defined as a number where the sum of its positive 
divisors are equal to itself.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_perfect_numbers

For egs: 
 - 6 (whose positive divisors are 1, 2, and 3) is 
    a  perfect number as 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
 - 10 (whose positive divisors are 1, 2, and 5) is not a 
    perfect number as 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

0 is not a perfect number.
