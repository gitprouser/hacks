/**
 * Given a list of meeting times, checks if any of them overlaps.
 * The follow-up question is to return the minimum number of rooms
 * required to accommodate all the meetings.
 *
 * Letâ€™s start with an example.
 *
 * q1: Check if any of the meeting overlaps.
 * q2: Return the minimum # of rooms required to accommodate all the meetings.
 *
 * Suppose we use interval (start, end) to denote the start and end
 * time of the meeting, we have the following meeting times: (1, 4), (5, 6), (8, 9), (2, 6).
 * In the above example, apparently we should return true for
 * the first question since (1, 4) and (2, 6) have overlaps.
 *
 *
 * For the follow-up question, we need at least 2 meeting rooms so that (1, 4), (5, 6) will be
 * put in one room and (2, 6), (8, 9) will be in the other.
 *
 * The meeting room scheduling problem was asked by Facebook very recently and
 * there are quite a few similar problems.
